===

Add E2E tests that test router navigation between two of your top-level states

* Get `protractor` set up and running
* Write a test that loading `/` loads the default state (url and component)
* Navigate to another state via a "click" and test (new url and new component)

# Rubric
* Protractor up and running *3pts*
* Tests make logical sense and test right thing *4pts*
* Design/Project Org *3pts*
